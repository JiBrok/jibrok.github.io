### System and Organization Controls (SOC) 2 at JiBrok

System and Organization Controls (SOC) 2 reports are independent third-party examination reports that demonstrate how JiBrok achieves key compliance controls and objectives. These reports are based on the existing Trust Services Criteria (TSC) from the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). The purpose of SOC 2 is to evaluate our information systems relevant to:
•	Security
•	Availability
•	Processing Integrity
•	Confidentiality
•	Privacy

JiBrok undergoes rigorous independent SOC 2 audits conducted by a reputable certified public accountant (CPA) firm on a regular basis. These audits evaluate whether our compliance controls are designed appropriately and are operating effectively over a specified period.

### Why SOC 2 Matters

By achieving and maintaining SOC 2, JiBrok demonstrates a strong commitment to protecting customer data and adhering to industry standards. SOC 2 attestation examinations follow the SSAE 18 standard (section AT-C 105 and 205) governed by the AICPA. Our compliance controls are regularly assessed to ensure that we:
•	Maintain consistent security practices
•	Address potential threats proactively
•	Continuously improve our policies and processes
