[comment]: <> (* Time between dates - Calculates the time between two dates from fields - system fields or custom. jql to search for ‚Äútime between dates‚Äù in time &#40;‚Äú>‚Äù, ‚Äú2h‚Äù&#41;)

[comment]: <> (* Formula &#40;number, string, date&#41; - Field for calculating the value using the specified formula&#40;script&#41;. You can use any system and user fields for calculation. You can customize the display. You can connect jql functions to search by time.)

[comment]: <> (* ...)


[comment]: <> (Now is the time to implement this for the Jira Cloud as well.)

[comment]: <> (In the cloud, this functionality is presented in the form of several applications. The Jira Cloud administrator will be able to connect only the functionality that is needed in his situation, and not drag everything into production.)

[comment]: <> (Unfortunately, we had to abandon the standard interface for creating fields in the Jira Cloud. And the Time in status fields are created and configured through the application interface.)

[comment]: <> (For each field, you specify the context, statuses for which you want to count the time, work calendar and time display format.)

[comment]: <> (Detailed instructions are available in [documentation]&#40;https://jibrok.com/docs/jbcf-cloud/jbcf-create-field/&#41;.)

[comment]: <> (After creating the field, the process of calculating values for tasks from the specified context will start. This may take a while. You can see the sync status on the [plugin service page]&#40;https://jibrok.com/docs/jbcf-cloud/service-info/&#41;.)



[comment]: <> (### Is something not working? Something is missing? ###)

[comment]: <> (We track errors in real time and try to fix them promptly. If you have encountered an error, then most likely we already know about it and it will be fixed in the next few hours.)

[comment]: <> (If the decision is delayed or the error is "logical", we would be very grateful for your message to the [support service]&#40;https://jibrok.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals&#41;.)

[comment]: <> (You can also contact with any questions or ideas and we will try to help you.)

[comment]: <> (We publish server work that may affect users on the [Status page]&#40;https://jbcf.statuspage.io/&#41;. The same information is duplicated on the application settings page.)
