During May, we will increase prices for all products and platforms. We are constantly investing in the development of our existing products, their support and the development of new products.

Applications became paid in 2020: [JiBrok paid apps](https://jibrok.com/JiBrok-paid-apps/)

Over the past couple of years, we have greatly expanded the capabilities of our solutions. This applies both to individual application functions and the platform on which they are available.
