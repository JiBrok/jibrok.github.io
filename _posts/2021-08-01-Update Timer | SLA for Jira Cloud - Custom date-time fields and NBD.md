We have updated the functionality in the Timer cloud application.
Now you can specify as a target for a timer not only time but also date time fields and additional options.

For each goal, the time is adjusted individually.
* If you select a time, for example 36 hours, the timer will start counting this time at the moment of start (start event).
* If you select a field of the date time type, which contains a date, then the field will count the remaining time until this date from the moment it was started.
* If you select the NBD option, then at the moment of start the timer will calculate the time until the end of the next working day (taking into account the selected calendar).

* We also wrote a small guide for the initial setup of the application - [üìñ How to create Timer and configure it step-by-step](/docs/timer-cloud/step-by-step-timer/)

* The start page now displays interactive examples of JQL queries.

* We also accelerated the updating of data in the fields and, in general, supplemented the interface with information.
