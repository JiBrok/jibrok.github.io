### [Message field](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1219615/message-field?hosting=server&tab=overview)


There are cases where such messages need to be placed in the task and shown to the user. This is often required when creating or viewing a problem. And to solve it, what could be simpler than just taking and adding the necessary message? Create a special message field. This field can only display a message from the settings.
Specify the message in the settings. Add a field to the screen. You're all set! 

This problem is partially solved without plugins â€“ by just adding a special javascript code to the field description. But what if you need to add a message to be displayed when viewing a task? Or when changing status where there are no fields except comment? Put a complex javascript injection plugin? No. It's easier to create a message field and add this field in the desired screen.
