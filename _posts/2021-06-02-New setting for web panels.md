Small update of functionality for panels from the application [Time in status](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1220908/time-in-status-sla-timer-stopwatch?hosting=cloud&tab=overview).

New settings are available in the [web panel configuration](https://jibrok.com/docs/tis-cloud/web-panel/).

### Administrator can turn off the display of statuses with zero time. ###

Now you can hide the display of statuses in which you have never been or spent working time in them.

### Administrator can change the location and weight of the web panel. ###

You can configure in which column the panel is displayed. Right or left.
