The administrator can grant any user the right to manage any group.

Before, only the administrator could grant access rights. But now, users managing groups can also give access to a project, space or transition to workflow.

Let's, for example, assume there is a development team with its permission schemes in Jira, Confluence and Bitbucket systems. Make the team leader responsible for team-A-users, team-A-reviewers and team-A-testers groups. Now, this team leader can grant access to the services and processes used by the team. He no longer needs to contact the administrator for this.
