#### New plugin for switching to another user. ####

![switch user jibrok-set user](/images/su/su-set-user.png)

The extension allows you to log in as another user.
This is useful for settings, problem solving, or quick help to the user.

In some cases, you can even transfer these rights to non-Jira administrators. For example, technical support staff or team leader.

Both problems are solved by this plugin.

And in case of incidents, information is recorded in the log who logged into the system under which user.
