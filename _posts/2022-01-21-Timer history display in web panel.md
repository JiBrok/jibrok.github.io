The other day we published improvements that allow you to work with the first launch of the timer. [More info](https://jibrok.com/History-of-restarts-for-the-timer/).
Today we have added a display of the previous timer values in the web panel.
<table>
<tr>
<td><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/uploads/timer-cloud/timerhistory-1.webp"><img src="/uploads/timer-cloud/timerhistory-1.webp" style="width:100%" loading="lazy"></a></p></td>
<td><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/uploads/timer-cloud/timerhistory-2.webp"><img src="/uploads/timer-cloud/timerhistory-2.webp" style="width:100%" loading="lazy"></a></p></td>
</tr>
</table>


Now, if the timer has a history of restarts, it will be displayed as a panel with access to the history. You can switch back and forth through history. Timers are arranged from new -> to old.

A little later settings for displaying the history will be added to the application admin panel. In particular, history display options.
We are also working on history functionality and will add the ability to account for different goals and timer setting changes.
