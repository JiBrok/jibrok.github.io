This privacy policy covers which personal data we have access to and how we handle this personal data.
### On-Premise Add-ons/Apps
While our on-premise add-ons (apps) do not collect any analytics, we do gather certain functional data to ensure optimal app performance. Specifically, we collect the user key, which is crucial for the internal workings of the app. This collection is strictly for operational purposes and is not used for any form of analytics or marketing.

It's paramount to underline that even though we collect the user key, this data does not leave your servers under any circumstances. We deeply respect and prioritize user privacy and data security. Your data remains strictly confined to your own infrastructure and is never transmitted or shared with any third parties.

### Atlassian Marketplace
Our add-ons/apps are sold on Atlassian Marketplace. If you generate an evaluation license or purchase a license for any of our add-ons, Atlassian Marketplace provides us contact information of the licensee. We don’t store this information in our own servers and we only access this through Atlassian Marketplace user interface when required. We don’t have any newsletter and we don’t send bulk emails but we may use this contact email address to notify you about our add-ons, for example expired license, security issues. You can opt-out anytime you want to and we will not send you any e-mail again.

### Support Request
To create a support request in our issue tracker you need to provide an email address and name. Our issue tracker allows public access and if you create an issue your name will be associated with the issue and it will be visible to others (your email is only visible to us, not others). If you prefer, you can contact us and ask that your request shall be private between you and us. We will process this request within 1 business day. At anytime you may request your account to be removed from our issue tracker and will comply with your request within 1 business day. If you prefer, you can completely skip our issue tracker and contact us directly for support requests. In that case your support request will be handled privately.
