This privacy policy covers which personal data we have access to and how we handle this personal data.
### On-Premise Add-ons/Apps
None of our on-premise add-ons (apps) collect any analytics or personal information. Your data does not leave your own servers under any circumstances.
### Atlassian Marketplace
Our add-ons/apps are sold on Atlassian Marketplace. If you generate an evaluation license or purchase a license for any of our add-ons, Atlassian Marketplace provides us contact information of the licensee. We don’t store this information in our own servers and we only access this through Atlassian Marketplace user interface when required. We don’t have any newsletter and we don’t send bulk emails but we may use this contact email address to notify you about our add-ons, for example expired license, security issues. You can opt-out anytime you want to and we will not send you any e-mail again.
### Support Request
To create a support request in our issue tracker you need to provide an email address and name. Our issue tracker allows public access and if you create an issue your name will be associated with the issue and it will be visible to others (your email is only visible to us, not others). If you prefer, you can contact us and ask that your request shall be private between you and us. We will process this request within 1 business day. At anytime you may request your account to be removed from our issue tracker and will comply with your request within 1 business day. If you prefer, you can completely skip our issue tracker and contact us directly for support requests. In that case your support request will be handled privately.
