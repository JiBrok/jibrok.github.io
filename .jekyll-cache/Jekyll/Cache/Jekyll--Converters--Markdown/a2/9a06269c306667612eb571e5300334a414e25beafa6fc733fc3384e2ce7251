<h3 id="-overview">ğŸ“ƒ Overview</h3>

<p>To calculate time in different scenarios, the plugin provides a set of fields, functions for searching, reports and access to api.</p>

<h3 id="-fields">ğŸ”§ Fields</h3>

<p>For all fields, you can sort and search, connect a working calendar to calculate the time, configure the appearance, access rights and export format.</p>

<h4 id="time-in-status-field">Time in status field</h4>

<p><img src="/images/time-in-status-field/time-in-status-demo1.png" alt="Plugin &quot;Time in status field/Timer/Stopwatch/SLA&quot; time-in-status field demo" /></p>

<p>A field that shows the time spent in the selected statuses. The field counts time dynamically. Not tied to issue events. Those. will count time for both new and already created tasks.</p>

<h4 id="stopwatch-field">Stopwatch field</h4>

<p>Tracks the time between events. Events can be as simple as creating a task, commenting. So are more complex ones - increasing priority, changing status to a specific, first appointment. Full list of events (link).</p>

<p>During startup, it is set for a certain time (5 minutes, 4 hours) and then shows the remaining time. Reacts to events (link). And depending on the settings, it starts the timer or stops. The initial time is determined by the jql condition.</p>
