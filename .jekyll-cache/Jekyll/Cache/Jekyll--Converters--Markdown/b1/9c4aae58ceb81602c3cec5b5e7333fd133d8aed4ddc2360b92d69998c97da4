<p>The extension allows you to log in as another user.
This is useful for settings, problem solving, or quick help to the user.</p>

<p>In some cases, you can even transfer these rights to non-Jira administrators. For example, technical support staff or team leader.</p>

<p>Both problems are solved by this plugin.</p>

<p>And in case of incidents, information is recorded in the log who logged into the system under which user.</p>
