<p>Functions take the following parameters.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>condition</strong> - one of the characters &lt;, &lt;=, =&gt; =,&gt;. For example: â€œ&gt;â€.</li>
  <li><strong>time</strong> - time string corresponding to one of the patterns.
    <ul>
      <li>â€œ5h35m12sâ€ - 5 hours 35 minutes 12 seconds</li>
      <li>â€œ5h12sâ€ - 5 hours 12 seconds</li>
      <li>3000m - 3000 minutes</li>
      <li>â€œ0â€, â€œ0sâ€ â€¦ - time is zero.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>calendar</strong> - the name or id of the calendar. For example: â€œSupportâ€ or â€œ1â€. How to view calendars?</li>
  <li><strong>timer config id</strong> and <strong>timer scheme id</strong> - number. Jira admin can view it.</li>
</ul>

  </li>
  <li><strong>â€œTimer fieldâ€œ in active()</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Returns tasks that have a timer is running</li>
      <li>If the timer uses a calendar, the field may indicate that it is not working hours. This does not affect the search if timer is running.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>â€œTimer fieldâ€œ in inactive()</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Returns tasks that have a timer is pause, failed or completed.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>â€œTimer fieldâ€œ in isCompleted()</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Returns tasks that have a timer is completed. Those the timer is stopped and the time has not yet ended.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>â€œTimer fieldâ€œ in isFailed()</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Returns tasks that have a timer is failed. Those the timer is stopped and the time has ended.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>â€œTimer fieldâ€œ in isPaused()</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Returns tasks that have a timer is paused. Breaks in the work calendar are not considered a pause. But can be displayed in the field as a pause.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>â€œTimer fieldâ€œ in isRunning()</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Returns tasks that have a timer is running. A break in the working calendar does not affect the search. The timer may be in state running, but at the same time the field will be displayed as a pause state.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>â€œTimer fieldâ€ in timeSpent(â€œconditionâ€, â€œtimeâ€)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Returns tasks for which the timer has already counted the specified time. Those. The timer was active(in state Running) for the specified time.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>â€œTimer fieldâ€ in realTimeSpent(â€œconditionâ€, â€œtimeâ€)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Returns tasks for which the timer has already counted the specified time. Those. The timer was active(in state Running) for the specified time.</li>
      <li>The function works in real time.</li>
      <li>It has a limit on the size of the issue.</li>
      <li>The function is suitable for sampling active counters. Real-time reporting, work queues of tasks with reference to reaction time, execution â€¦</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>â€œTimer fieldâ€ in timeLeft(â€œconditionâ€, â€œtimeâ€)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Returns tasks for which the remaining timer time matches the condition.</li>
      <li>The function works in real time.</li>
      <li>It hasnâ€™t a limit on the size of the issue.</li>
      <li>The function is suitable for sampling active counters. Real-time reporting, work queues of tasks with reference to reaction time, execution â€¦</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>â€œTimer fieldâ€ in searchByCalendar(â€œcalendarIdâ€)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Returns tasks whose timer uses the specified attribute.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>â€œTimer fieldâ€ in searchByGoal(â€œgoalIdâ€)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Returns tasks whose timer uses the specified attribute.</li>
      <li>Id can be found with Jira admin.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>â€œTimer fieldâ€ in searchByTimerConfig(â€œtimerConfigIdâ€)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Returns tasks whose timer uses the specified attribute.</li>
