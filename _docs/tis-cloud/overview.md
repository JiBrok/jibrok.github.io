## Welcome to Time in status for Jira Cloud!


The issue (task, work) during the solving process goes through various stages. It is necessary to take it into account and control the time spent at each stage.

The plugin provides fields, JQL functions for searching and reports.


### Time in status field ###
* A field that shows the time spent in the selected statuses. It's easy to use and serves to solve typical problems - calculating the time in status.<br>
  "How long has the task been open? How long was the task in work? How long did it wait for the reaction?" and so on.

Fields have functions for finding information using jql.
Fields can calculate their values both for new(based on issue events) and old issues(based on the history of issues).  
Fields have a large number of time format for display.

</tr>

### Business calendar: ###

The plugin can calculate the time according to the configured calendars. In fields and jql there are corresponding settings.
You can create an unlimited number of calendars and use it in any contexts and projects.
