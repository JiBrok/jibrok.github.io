## Welcome to Switch to User + Delegating SU (Jira)!

Take a look at Jira from another user.

In a couple of clicks, the administrator can go under another user and study the problem with his own eyes. 
* This is extremely useful when providing support to users and development. 
* Shortcuts are available for quick switching. 
* And any use of SU is logged and you can always restore from the audit logs who, when and under what user logged into Jira.
* There is also an advanced functionality that allows you to give selected users the opportunity to log in under other users. You can delegate these rights personally or to the groups.


### Switch to User (USER and ADMIN) ###

Switching to another user is available from the user menu or by url in you Jira **'/secure/jibrokSuSetUser.jspa'** or Go to from admin search (hot key gg) 'SU Login as another user'
