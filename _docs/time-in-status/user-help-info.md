## *Common* ##

### Time in status ###
Functions for searching issues by time spent in statuses.
These functions are available by default. If not, please contact your Jira admin. 

* **issue in timeInStatus("statuses", "condition", "time")** - Find issues that spent the specified time in statuses.
    * Params:
    * statuses - name or id, Comma separated
* **issue in timeInStatusByJql("jql", "statuses", "condition", "time")** - Find issues from a jql request that spent the specified time in statuses.
    * Params: 
    * jql - query for filter tasks
    * statuses - name or id, Comma separated
* **issue in timeInStatusByJqlAndWorkCalendar("jql", "statuses", "condition", "time", "calendar")** - Find issues from a jql request that spent the specified working time in statuses. Working hours will be calculated according to the specified calendar.
    * Params:
    * jql - query for filter tasks
    * statuses - name or id, Comma separated
    * calendar - work calendar name or id for calculate work time


* **Examples:**
    * issue in timeInStatus("Done, In Progress", ">", "8h")
    * issue in timeInStatusByJqlAndWorkCalendar("project = TEST", "Done", ">", "3h", "General calendar")

* If several statuses are specified, the search is based on the sum of the time spent in the specified statues.
* Status names are case sensitive. If the name does not match, the function will prompt the correct spelling options for the status.
* Use "OR" and "AND" to search different statues: issue in timeInStatus("status A", ">", "time") or issue in timeInStatus("status B", ">", "time")
* If possible use functions with jql. They narrow the search and execute faster. 



### Compare fields ###
Functions that allow you to compare different fields with each other. The functions work with "number", "string" and "time" fields.
Returns issues whose fields satisfy the condition.

* **issue in compareFields("field 1", "condition", "field 2")** - Field comparison function. Finds tasks in which fields match a condition.
    * Params: 
    * "field 1" and "field 2"  - field name or field id
* **issue in compareFieldsByJql("jql", "field 1", "condition", "field 2")** -  Field comparison function. Finds tasks in which fields match a condition and jql.
    * Params:
    * jql - query for filter tasks
    * "field 1" and "field 2"  - field name or field id

* **Examples:**
    * issue in compareFields("Time in status New", ">", "Time in status In progress")
    * issue in compareFields("Number field", ">", "Another number field")
    * issue in compareFields("Project = TEST", "String field", ">", "Another number field")
    
* If possible use functions with jql. They narrow the search and execute faster.
* In the case of string fields, the function will try to convert the string to a number for correct comparison.

### Compare date from field and date by work calendar ###

The *comparisonDateFromFieldAndDateByWorkCalendar* function is used to compare a date from a specified field with a computed date based on a given relative time and a specified work calendar. The behavior of the function is as follows:


* **comparisonDateFromFieldAndDateByWorkCalendar("field", "condition", "time", "calendar")**
  * Params:
  * "field" - The name of the field to be searched and compared. It can be the name or ID of a system field or a custom field.
  * "condition" - The condition for comparing the date from the first field with the computed date. Possible values are <, <=, =, >=, >.
  * "time" - A string representing the time relative to the current time, entered in the format "-1h 30m", for example. This value is used to calculate the date based on the specified work calendar.
  * "calendar" - The name or ID of the work calendar. The computed date is calculated based on this calendar and the specified relative time.

Behavior:

* The function retrieves the value from the specified "field".
* The current date is computed based on the specified "work calendar" and the relative "time" relative to the current time. For example, if the current time is 9:00 AM and relativeTime is "-1h 30m" (one and a half working hours ago), the computed date will represent 7:30 AM of the current working day according to the specified calendar.
* The computed date is compared with the date from the specified "field" using the specified comparison operator ("condition"). For example, if "condition" is >, it checks if the date from the "field" is more than the computed date .

* **Examples**
    * issue in comparisonDateFromFieldAndDateByWorkCalendar("updated", ">", "-1h", "Calendar Name") - find all issues that have been updated for the last working hour(-1h) on the working calendar. Like: "updated > -1h", but -1h by work calendar.

### Autotrack ###

Works if the automatic time tracking function is enabled.  

* **issue in myAutoTrackTickets()** -  Returns user issues with configured automatic timers or stopwatches.
