Searchable. Returns the number of specified transitions completed by the task.

Transitions are set in the settings (a pair of from statuses and to statuses). Shows the amount for all pairs. Each pair is calculated as from any "From" to any "To".
for example:
From: New, Open
That: Closed
The transitions New -> Closed and Open-> Closed will be counted.
