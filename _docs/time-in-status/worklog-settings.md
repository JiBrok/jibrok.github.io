This setting allows you to automatically record the time of timers and stopwatches in the task worklog. <br>
The Jira administrator specifies which comment to write to the fixed time and for which user. <br>
Optionally, a notification about an entry in the worklog is indicated. <br>
Next, you will need to enable this setting in the timer or stopwatch configuration. <br>

It works like this. <br>
When the timer or stopwatch stops (STOP or PAUSE), the time since the last start of the counter is calculated and this time is recorded in the worklog.
