In different situations, there is a need for manual data control. If there are few requests or they occur periodically, then you can issue the rights to users for manual control of counters (timers and stopwatches). This is set in the field configuration and allows users to manually start and stop counters.


In a different situation, there can be a lot of counters for point control. In this case, the administrator can massively apply the action to the counters. [Action details](/docs/time-in-status/timers-and-stopwatches-general-information/)
<br> For example, it can be used to massively stop timers.

The administrator specifies:
* JQL
* Fields
* Action
* Additional settings

In tasks from JQL, the specified action will be performed for these fields.
