Here are the key points that will help you navigate the application settings:  

1. Once the application is installed, common JQL functions are available to search by time in status: [Time in status - JQL](/docs/time-in-status/time-in-status-jql/)
2. The plugin help from the Jira menu is available for users: [User help info](/docs/time-in-status/user-help-info/) 
3. The plugin can use working calendars to calculate time. More information about calendars and how to configure them: [Work calendars](/docs/time-in-status/work-calendar/)
4. The next page summarizes the key differences and features of the fields. This information will help you decide which field is appropriate for your situation: [About fields](/docs/time-in-status/about-fields/)
5. Step-by-step instructions to help with initial field configuration:
    1. [Step by step Time in status](/docs/time-in-status/step-by-step-time-in-status/)
    1. [Step by step Timer](/docs/time-in-status/step-by-step-timer/)
6. Plugin settings.
    1. By default, the plugin tries to minimize the use of server resources. You can change the resource limits on the pages [Performance config - JQL](/docs/time-in-status/performance-config-jql/) and [Performance config - multithreading](/docs/time-in-status/performance-config-multithreading/). Allocating additional threads can increase the computation speed by hundreds of percent.
    1. Some reports are available directly from the issue. This slightly complicates the interface in cases where this functionality is not needed. You can fine-tune reports and their display in the issue: [Bottom panel configs](/docs/time-in-status/bottom-panel-configs/)
    1. Time counters can be displayed as side panels, the location of which can be changed:  [Field panel configs](/docs/time-in-status/field-panel-configs/)
7. By default, only Jira admins can create reports. Administrators can grant reporting permissions to users, groups, or roles. [Reports permissions](/docs/time-in-status/reports-permissions/)
