Automatic migration of settings is under development.

Currently, the application requires manual transfer of settings.
You don't need to migrate data from issues. <b>You only need to transfer the settings for calendars, fields, and panels</b>.
Some [things are missing](/docs/stopwatch-cloud/featureDifferenceDocumentation/) in the cloud version of the app.

A checklist for transferring settings:
1. Transfer work calendars. They have the same interfaces, and you need to create copies.
2. For each "Stopwatch" field, you need to create a new field with appropriate settings.
3. If the "Stopwatch" field was displayed as a sidebar on the server, then you need to create a new web panel in the cloud (Coming soon ðŸ› ).
4. If you transfer user filters, then you need to take into account: the field ID in the cloud will differ from the server ones, and not all JQL functions from the server are available in the cloud.
